# demultiplex_and_assembly_TCR
This pipeline was designed to demultiplex and assembly reads from PCR-amplified TCR sequences of multiple samples based on the protocol described in [Han, A., Glanville, J., Hansmann, L. et al. Linking T-cell receptor sequence to functional phenotype at the single-cell level. Nat Biotechnol 32, 684â€“692 (2014).] (https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2938)
